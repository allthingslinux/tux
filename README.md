## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) or any PostgreSQL database
- Optional: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Optional: [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (see the [development notes](#development-notes) for more information)
- Optional: [Just](https://github.com/casey/just/)

### Steps to Install

Assuming you have the prerequisites installed, follow these steps to get started with the development of the project:

Further detailed instructions can be found in the [development guide](docs/development.md).

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/allthingslinux/tux && cd tux
   ```

2. Install the project's dependencies and set up the virtual environment

    ```bash
    poetry install
    poetry env use 3.13
    ```

3. Install the pre-commit hooks (optional unless you are contributing)

    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

4. Generate the prisma client and push the database schema

    ```bash
    prisma generate
    prisma db push
    ```

    Currently, you will need to have a Supabase database set up and the URL set in the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

    In the future, we will provide a way to use a local database. We can provide a dev database on request.

5. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    You'll need to fill in your Discord bot token here, as well as the Sentry DSN if you want to use Sentry for error tracking.

    We offer dev tokens on request in our Discord server.

6. Copy the `config/settings.yml.example` file to `config/settings.yml` and fill in the required values.

    ```bash
    cp config/settings.yml.example config/settings.yml
    ```

    Be sure to add your Discord user ID to the `BOT_OWNER` key in the settings file.

    You can also add your custom prefix here.

7. Start the bot!

    ```bash
    poetry run python tux/main.py
    ```

8. Run the clear tree command in the server to sync the slash command tree.

   ```bash
   {prefix}dev ct
   ```

## Development Notes

> [!NOTE]
Make sure to add your Discord User ID to the sys admin list if you are testing locally.

> [!NOTE]
Make sure to set the Prisma schema database ENV variable to the DEV database URL.

> [!NOTE]
If you want to develop Tux using Docker Compose, we recommend using `docker compose up --watch` for hot reloading.
