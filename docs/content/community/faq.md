### What's the difference between timeout and jail?

- **Timeout**: Uses Discord's built-in timeout feature (max 28 days)
- **Jail**: Uses a custom role system that you configure (unlimited duration)

### Why can't the bot moderate certain users?

The bot cannot moderate:

- Server owner
- Users with roles higher than the bot's role
- Other bots (in most cases)
- Users the bot doesn't have permission to moderate

## Troubleshooting

### The bot isn't responding to commands

1. Check if bot is online (green status)
2. Verify bot has "Send Messages" permission
3. Try both `/help` and `!help`
4. Check if you're using the correct prefix

### Commands return "Missing Permissions" error

1. Check bot's role permissions in server settings
2. Ensure bot role is above target user roles
3. Verify bot has the specific permission needed (kick, ban, etc.)

### "You don't have permission" error

1. Check with server admin about your permission level
2. Ask server admin to adjust your permissions
3. Check if the command is whitelisted for your role

### Database errors

These are usually temporary. Try the command again in a few minutes. If the issue persists, report
it on GitHub.

### Bot seems slow or unresponsive

1. Check `/ping` for latency
2. Check Discord's status page for API issues
3. Report persistent issues in our Discord server
