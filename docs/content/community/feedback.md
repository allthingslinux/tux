# Feedback

If you want to give feedback we would love to hear your thoughts! We have multiple ways for you to provide feedback.

## GitHub Issues

The best way to give us feedback is through a Github Issue. Go to [our Issues Page](https://github.com/allthingslinux/tux/issues) and check if your feedback has already been posted. If not, click on "New Issue" to create an issue and fill out the provided template.

If you do not have a GitHub account, you can create one for free at [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup).

## Discord Server

You can also provide feedback through our Discord server.
