# Wolfram

The `wolfram` command provides direct access to the [Wolfram|Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com) computational knowledge engine.

It allows you to perform complex mathematical calculations, unit conversions, scientific inquiries, and general factual queries, receiving a comprehensive visual result directly within Discord.

## Syntax

The `wolfram` command can be used in two ways:

**Slash Command:**

```text
/wolfram query:STRING
```

**Prefix Command:**

```text
$wolfram <query>
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `query` | STRING | Yes | The natural language query or mathematical expression (e.g., `integrate x^2`, `distance to mars`). |

## Usage Examples

### Mathematics

Solve equations or perform calculus.

```text
/wolfram query:"solve 2x + 5 = 15"
/wolfram query:"integrate sin(x)"
```

### Science and Facts

Get data about the world.

```text
/wolfram query:"mass of Jupiter"
/wolfram query:"What is the capital of France?"
```

### Conversions

Convert units or currencies.

```text
/wolfram query:"100 USD to EUR"
/wolfram query:"10 miles in kilometers"
```

## Response

When executed, the bot sends an informational embed containing the query title and an **image result** generated by Wolfram|Alpha. This image typically includes the interpreted query, the step-by-step solution or facts, and relevant graphs or tables.

## Behavior Notes

- **Processing Time:** Computational queries may take several seconds to process. The bot will show a "thinking" status during this time.
- **Image Format:** Results are delivered as a cropped high-quality image ensuring the most relevant data is clearly visible.
