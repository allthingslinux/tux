# Wolfram

The `wolfram` command provides direct access to the [Wolfram|Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com) computational knowledge engine.

It allows you to perform complex mathematical calculations, unit conversions, scientific inquiries, and general factual queries, receiving a comprehensive visual result directly within Discord.

## Syntax

The `wolfram` command can be used in two ways:

**Slash Command:**

```text
/wolfram query:STRING
```

**Prefix Command:**

```text
$wolfram <query>
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `query` | STRING | Yes | The natural language query or mathematical expression (e.g., `integrate x^2`, `distance to mars`). |

## Usage Examples

### Mathematics

Solve equations or perform calculus.

```text
/wolfram query:"solve 2x + 5 = 15"
/wolfram query:"integrate sin(x)"
```

### Science and Facts

Get data about the world.

```text
/wolfram query:"mass of Jupiter"
/wolfram query:"What is the capital of France?"
```

### Conversions

Convert units or currencies.

```text
/wolfram query:"100 USD to EUR"
/wolfram query:"10 miles in kilometers"
```

## Response Format

When executed, the bot sends an informational embed containing:

- **Query title** - Your original query formatted as a title
- **Image result** - A high-quality image generated by Wolfram|Alpha containing:
  - The interpreted query
  - Step-by-step solutions (for mathematical problems)
  - Relevant graphs, charts, or tables
  - Factual data and statistics
  - Unit conversions with visual representations

The image is automatically cropped and optimized to show the most relevant information clearly.

## Behavior Notes

- **Processing time:** Computational queries may take several seconds to process - the bot shows a "thinking" status during this time
- **Image format:** Results are delivered as a high-quality PNG image optimized for Discord display
- **Query interpretation:** Wolfram|Alpha automatically interprets your natural language query and provides relevant results
- **Timeout:** Queries that take longer than 10 seconds will timeout - try simplifying your query if this occurs

## Error Handling

### Query Timeout

**When it occurs:** When a query takes longer than 10 seconds to process.

**What happens:** The bot sends an error message indicating the query timed out.

**Solutions:**

- Simplify your query
- Break complex queries into smaller parts
- Try rephrasing your question
- Check your internet connection

### Invalid Query

**When it occurs:** When Wolfram|Alpha cannot interpret your query.

**What happens:** The bot may return an error or an image indicating the query couldn't be processed.

**Solutions:**

- Rephrase your query in clearer language
- Use more specific terms
- Check spelling and grammar
- Try breaking the query into simpler parts
