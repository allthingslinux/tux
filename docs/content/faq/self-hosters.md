# For Self-Hosters

## What do I need to self-host Tux?

**Required:** Python 3.13+, [PostgreSQL 17+](https://www.postgresql.org/), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and a [Discord bot token](../selfhost/config/bot-token.md).

**Recommended:** [Docker and Docker Compose](../selfhost/install/docker.md) for the simplest setup. See the [Self-Hoster Guide](../selfhost/index.md) for full requirements.

## Where do I get a Discord bot token?

In the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications): create an application, add a bot, then copy the token. See the [Bot Token Guide](../selfhost/config/bot-token.md) for step-by-step instructions and required permissions.
