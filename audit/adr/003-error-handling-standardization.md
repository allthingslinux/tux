# ADR-003: Error Handling Standardization

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The current Tux Discord bot has inconsistent error handling across modules:

- Some cogs use try/catch with custom error messages
- Others rely on discord.py's default error handling
- Sentry integration is inconsistent and incomplete
- User-facing error messages lack standardization
- Error context and debugging information varies widely
- No centralized error processing or recovery mechanisms

This inconsistency leads to poor user experience, difficult debugging, and maintenance overhead. The system needs standardized error handling that provides consistent user feedback while maintaining comprehensive logging and monitoring.

## Decision

Implement a structured error handling system with:

1. **Hierarchical Error Types**: Custom exception hierarchy for different error categories
2. **Centralized Error Processing**: Global error handler with context-aware processing
3. **User-Friendly Messages**: Consistent, helpful error messages for users
4. **Enhanced Sentry Integration**: Comprehensive error tracking with proper context
5. **Recovery Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation and automatic recovery where possible

## Rationale

Structured error handling was chosen because it:

- Provides consistent user experience across all bot features
- Enables better debugging through standardized error context
- Supports proper error categorization and handling strategies
- Integrates well with monitoring and alerting systems
- Allows for graceful degradation in failure scenarios

Centralized processing ensures consistency while allowing for context-specific handling where needed. The hierarchical approach enables different handling strategies for different error types.

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Keep Current Ad-hoc Error Handling

- Description: Continue with inconsistent per-cog error handling
- Pros: No refactoring required, familiar patterns
- Cons: Poor user experience, difficult debugging, maintenance overhead
- Why rejected: Doesn't address fundamental consistency and usability issues

### Alternative 2: Simple Global Exception Handler

- Description: Single catch-all exception handler for all errors
- Pros: Simple to implement, consistent handling
- Cons: Loss of context-specific handling, poor error categorization
- Why rejected: Too simplistic for complex bot operations

### Alternative 3: Result/Either Pattern

- Description: Use functional programming patterns for error handling
- Pros: Explicit error handling, no exceptions, composable
- Cons: Significant paradigm shift, learning curve, Python ecosystem mismatch
- Why rejected: Too different from Python conventions and team experience

## Consequences

### Positive

- Consistent user experience across all bot features
- Improved debugging through standardized error context
- Better error monitoring and alerting capabilities
- Reduced maintenance overhead for error handling code
- Enhanced system reliability through proper recovery mechanisms

### Negative

- Requires refactoring of existing error handling code
- Team needs to learn new error handling patterns
- Potential performance overhead from additional error processing
- Increased complexity in simple error scenarios

### Neutral

- Changes to exception handling patterns throughout codebase
- New error type definitions and hierarchies
- Updated logging and monitoring configurations

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Error Hierarchy and Infrastructure

1. Define custom exception hierarchy for different error categories:
   - `TuxError` (base exception)
   - `UserError` (user input/permission issues)
   - `SystemError` (internal system failures)
   - `ExternalError` (third-party service failures)
   - `ConfigurationError` (configuration issues)

2. Create centralized error processor with context handling
3. Implement user-friendly error message system
4. Set up enhanced Sentry integration with proper context

### Phase 2: Core Error Handling

1. Implement global Discord error handler
2. Add error recovery mechanisms for common failure scenarios
3. Create error response formatting utilities
4. Set up error logging with appropriate severity levels

### Phase 3: Service Integration

1. Update all services to use standardized error types
2. Implement service-specific error handling strategies
3. Add error context propagation through service layers
4. Create error handling middleware for common operations

### Phase 4: Cog Migration

1. Update all cogs to use centralized error handling
2. Remove ad-hoc error handling code
3. Implement cog-specific error context where needed
4. Add comprehensive error handling tests

### Success Criteria

- All errors use standardized exception hierarchy
- Users receive consistent, helpful error messages
- All errors are properly logged and monitored
- System gracefully handles and recovers from common failures

## Compliance

### Code Review Guidelines

- All exceptions must inherit from appropriate base error types
- Error messages must be user-friendly and actionable
- Proper error context must be included for debugging
- Sentry integration must be used for all system errors

### Automated Checks

- Linting rules to enforce error type usage
- Tests to verify error handling coverage
- Monitoring alerts for error rate thresholds

### Documentation Requirements

- Error handling patterns guide for developers
- User error message guidelines
- Troubleshooting documentation for common errors

## Related Decisions

- [ADR-002](002-service-layer-architecture.md): Service Layer Architecture
- [ADR-001](001-dependency-injection-strategy.md): Dependency Injection Strategy
- Requirements 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4

## Notes

This standardization should improve both developer and user experience while providing better system observability. Implementation should prioritize the most common error scenarios first.
