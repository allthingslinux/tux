# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the Tux Discord bot project. ADRs document important architectural decisions, their context, and rationale.

## What is an ADR?

An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams:

- Understand the reasoning behind past decisions
- Avoid revisiting settled questions
- Onboard new team members more effectively
- Learn from past decisions and their outcomes

## ADR Process

1. **Proposal**: Create a new ADR using the template in `template.md`
2. **Discussion**: Share the ADR for team review and feedback
3. **Decision**: Update status to "Accepted" or "Rejected" based on team consensus
4. **Implementation**: Track implementation progress if accepted
5. **Review**: Periodically review ADRs and update status if needed

## ADR Statuses

- **Proposed**: Under consideration
- **Accepted**: Approved for implementation
- **Rejected**: Not approved
- **Deprecated**: No longer relevant
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision
