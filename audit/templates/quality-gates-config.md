# Quality Gates Configuration

This document defines the quality gates and acceptance criteria for the Tux Discord bot project.

## Overview

Quality gates are automated and manual checkpoints that ensure code quality, security, and performance standards are met before code is merged and deployed.

## Automated Quality Gates

### Continuous Improvement

- **Weekly Reviews**: Review gate effectiveness and failure patterns
- **Monthly Analysis**: Analyze trends and identify improvement opportunities
- **Quarterly Updates**: Update thresholds and criteria based on data
- **Annual Review**: Comprehensive review of entire quality gate system

---

**Note**: Quality gates should be regularly reviewed and updated based on project needs, team feedback, and industry best practices. The goal is to maintain high quality while not impeding development velocity.
