## Implementation Guidelines

### Architectural Patterns

#### **Dependency Injection Pattern**

```python
# Container registration
from tux.core.container import Container

container = Container()
container.register(UserService, UserService)
container.register(DatabaseController, DatabaseController)

# Service resolution in cogs
class UserCog(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot: Tux, user_service: UserService):
        self.bot = bot
        self.user_service = user_service
```

#### **Service Layer Pattern**

```python
# Service implementation
class UserService:
    def __init__(self, user_repo: UserRepository, logger: Logger):
        self.user_repo = user_repo
        self.logger = logger
    
    async def get_user_profile(self, user_id: int) -> UserProfile:
        # Business logic implementation
        pass
```

#### **Repository Pattern**

```python
# Repository implementation
class UserRepository(BaseRepository[User]):
    async def get_by_username(self, username: str) -> Optional[User]:
        return await self.db.user.find_first(
            where={"username": username}
        )
```

### Code Quality Standards

#### **Type Hints**

All functions must include comprehensive type hints:

```python
from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any

async def process_user_data(
    user_id: int,
    options: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
) -> Optional[User]:
    pass
```

#### **Error Handling**

Use structured error handling with custom exceptions:

```python
from tux.utils.exceptions import TuxError, UserNotFoundError

try:
    user = await self.user_service.get_user(user_id)
except UserNotFoundError:
    raise TuxError("User not found", user_friendly=True)
```

#### **Logging**

Use structured logging throughout:

```python
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger(__name__)

async def process_request(self, request_id: str):
    logger.info("Processing request", request_id=request_id)
    try:
        result = await self._do_processing()
        logger.info("Request completed", request_id=request_id)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error("Request failed", request_id=request_id, error=str(e))
        raise
```
