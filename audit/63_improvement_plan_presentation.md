## Slide 4: Technical Architecture Vision

### Current vs. Future Architecture

#### **Current Pattern (Legacy)**

```python
class MyCog(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot: Tux) -> None:
        self.bot = bot
        self.db = DatabaseController()  # Manual instantiation
        # Business logic mixed with presentation
```

#### **Future Pattern (Target)**

```python
class MyCog(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot: Tux, user_service: UserService, logger: Logger):
        self.bot = bot
        self.user_service = user_service  # Injected dependency
        self.logger = logger
        # Clean separation of concerns
```

### Key Improvements

- **40% reduction** in boilerplate code
- **Improved testability** through dependency injection
- **Clear separation** of business and presentation logic
- **Consistent patterns** across all modules
