# TUX DISCORD BOT - AUTOMATED MAINTENANCE & HOUSEKEEPING WORKFLOW
# ==============================================================================
#
# This workflow handles automated maintenance tasks for the Tux Discord bot
# project, ensuring repository health, code quality tracking, and resource
# management. It provides intelligent automation for routine maintenance
# tasks while offering manual controls for administrative operations.
#
# MAINTENANCE CAPABILITIES:
# -------------------------
# 1. Automated TODO/FIXME conversion to GitHub issues for task tracking
# 2. Docker image registry cleanup to prevent storage bloat
# 3. Repository health monitoring and reporting
# 4. Dependency freshness tracking and alerts
# 5. Repository statistics and metrics collection
#
# AUTOMATION STRATEGY:
# --------------------
# - TODO Management: Real-time conversion on code changes
# - Image Cleanup: Monthly scheduled cleanup with configurable retention
# - Health Checks: Monthly comprehensive repository analysis
# - Manual Override: Administrative controls for immediate execution
#
# RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
# --------------------
# - Intelligent scheduling spread across different days
# - Configurable retention policies for different resource types
# - Non-blocking execution with graceful failure handling
# - Comprehensive logging for audit trails and debugging
#

# MAINTENANCE WORKFLOW BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED
# ==============================================================================
#
# 1. AUTOMATED TASK MANAGEMENT:
#    - Real-time TODO to issue conversion for comprehensive task tracking
#    - Intelligent categorization (TODO → enhancement, FIXME → bug)
#    - Automatic assignment to commit authors for accountability
#    - Smart exclusion patterns to avoid maintenance noise
#
# 2. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
#    - Configurable Docker image retention policies
#    - Scheduled cleanup to prevent storage bloat
#    - Manual override capabilities for immediate administrative action
#    - Conservative defaults with explicit administrative controls
#
# 3. REPOSITORY HEALTH MONITORING:
#    - Comprehensive file size analysis for performance optimization
#    - Dependency freshness tracking for security and feature updates
#    - Project metrics collection for development planning
#    - Structured reporting for maintenance decision making
#
# 4. OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE:
#    - Non-blocking execution with graceful failure handling
#    - Comprehensive logging for audit trails and debugging
#    - Intelligent scheduling to avoid resource conflicts
#    - Manual override capabilities for emergency situations
#
# MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE:
# ---------------------
# - TODO Conversion: Real-time on every main branch push
# - Image Cleanup: Monthly on the 1st at 3 AM UTC
# - Health Checks: Monthly comprehensive analysis
# - Manual Triggers: Available for immediate administrative needs
#
# RETENTION POLICIES:
# -------------------
# - Docker Images: 10 versions by default (configurable)
# - Untagged Images: Preserved by default (configurable)
# - Issues: Automatically closed when TODOs are resolved
# - Logs: Retained according to GitHub Actions standard retention
#
# ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS:
# ------------------------
# - Manual image cleanup with custom retention settings
# - Custom TODO scanning with specific commit ranges
# - Immediate execution override for emergency maintenance
# - Configurable cleanup policies for different scenarios
