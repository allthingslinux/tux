# TUX DISCORD BOT - COMPREHENSIVE TEST SUITE WORKFLOW
# ==============================================================================
#
# This workflow executes the complete test suite for the Tux Discord bot,
# providing comprehensive testing across multiple Python versions with detailed
# coverage reporting and result archival. Designed for reliability and
# comprehensive validation of all code paths.
#
# TESTING STRATEGY:
# -----------------
# 1. Multi-version Python testing (3.13) for compatibility
# 2. Categorized test execution (Unit, Database, Integration)
# 3. Intelligent test discovery and conditional execution
# 4. Parallel test execution for performance optimization
# 5. Comprehensive coverage reporting with multiple flags
# 6. Artifact preservation for debugging and analysis
#
# COVERAGE STRATEGY:
# ------------------
# - Unit Tests: Fast tests covering core functionality
# - Database Tests: Focused on database operations and models
# - Integration Tests: End-to-end scenarios marked as "slow"
# - Separate coverage reports for different test categories
# - Codecov integration for coverage tracking and visualization
#
# PERFORMANCE FEATURES:
# ---------------------
# - Smart change detection to skip unnecessary test runs
# - Python version-specific caching for faster dependency installation
# - Parallel pytest execution when test count justifies overhead
# - Conditional test suite execution based on test discovery
# - Efficient artifact management with reasonable retention periods
#
# RELIABILITY FEATURES:
# ---------------------
# - Matrix strategy with fail-fast disabled to see all failures
# - Integration test failures don't fail CI (continue-on-error)
# - Robust coverage file handling with debugging support
# - Test result upload even on test failures (!cancelled())
# - Comprehensive error handling and status reporting
