# TUX DISCORD BOT - COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY SCANNING WORKFLOW
# ==============================================================================
#
# This workflow provides comprehensive security scanning and vulnerability
# management for the Tux Discord bot project. It implements multiple layers
# of security analysis including static code analysis, dependency scanning,
# and automated security advisory management with intelligent automation
# for low-risk updates.
#
# SECURITY CAPABILITIES:
# ----------------------
# 1. Multi-language static analysis with GitHub CodeQL
# 2. Dependency vulnerability scanning and review
# 3. Automated security advisory monitoring
# 4. Intelligent Dependabot auto-merge for patch/minor updates
# 5. Comprehensive vulnerability reporting and tracking
#
# SCANNING STRATEGY:
# ------------------
# - CodeQL: Weekly comprehensive analysis for vulnerabilities
# - Dependency Review: Real-time analysis on pull requests
# - Safety Check: Continuous monitoring of Python dependencies
# - Dependabot: Automated updates with intelligent approval
#
# AUTOMATION FEATURES:
# --------------------
# - Auto-approval of patch and minor dependency updates
# - Centralized security event reporting via SARIF
# - Intelligent scheduling to avoid resource conflicts
# - Conservative security policies with manual override options
#

# ==============================================================================
# SECURITY WORKFLOW BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED
# ==============================================================================
#
# 1. DEFENSE IN DEPTH:
#    - Multi-layer security analysis (static, dynamic, dependency)
#    - Comprehensive language coverage (Python, GitHub Actions)
#    - Real-time and scheduled scanning strategies
#    - Automated and manual security review processes
#
# 2. INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION:
#    - Conservative auto-merge policies for low-risk updates
#    - Repository-restricted execution to prevent supply chain attacks
#    - Fail-safe mechanisms with manual override capabilities
#    - Structured reporting for audit trails and compliance
#
# 3. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
#    - Strategic scheduling to avoid resource conflicts
#    - Targeted scanning based on change context (PR vs main)
#    - Efficient caching and dependency management
#    - Resource-aware execution with appropriate timeouts
#
# 4. INTEGRATION & REPORTING:
#    - GitHub Security tab integration via SARIF
#    - Automated PR commenting for immediate feedback
#    - Artifact storage for security audit trails
#    - Centralized vulnerability management and tracking
#
# SECURITY COVERAGE:
# ------------------
# - Static Analysis: CodeQL for Python and GitHub Actions
# - Dependency Scanning: Real-time vulnerability assessment
# - Advisory Monitoring: Continuous security advisory tracking
# - Supply Chain: Automated dependency update management
# - Compliance: Structured reporting and audit trail maintenance
#
# AUTOMATION POLICIES:
# --------------------
# - Auto-approve: Patch and minor version updates only
# - Manual review: Major version updates and security-sensitive changes
# - Fail-safe: Conservative defaults with explicit override mechanisms
# - Audit trail: Comprehensive logging and artifact retention
