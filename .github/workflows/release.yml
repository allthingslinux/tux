# TUX DISCORD BOT - AUTOMATED RELEASE MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW
# ==============================================================================
#
# This workflow automates the release process for the Tux Discord bot,
# providing intelligent version management, comprehensive changelog generation,
# and automated release deployment. It ensures releases are properly tested,
# documented, and deployed with appropriate versioning and metadata.
#
# RELEASE CAPABILITIES:
# ---------------------
# 1. Automated release creation from git tags or manual triggers
# 2. Intelligent prerelease detection and handling
# 3. Comprehensive changelog generation from commit history
# 4. Integration with test suite validation before release
# 5. Automated GitHub release creation with proper metadata
#
# VERSIONING STRATEGY:
# --------------------
# - Semantic Versioning (SemVer): v1.2.3 format for releases
# - Prerelease Support: Alpha, beta, rc versions with special handling
# - Manual Override: Administrative control for custom release scenarios
# - Git Tag Integration: Automatic detection and processing of version tags
#
# QUALITY ASSURANCE:
# ------------------
# - Test Suite Integration: Waits for test completion before release
# - Version Validation: Ensures proper version format and consistency
# - Changelog Generation: Automated documentation of changes
# - Release Notes: Enhanced GitHub release notes with commit details
#
# ==============================================================================
