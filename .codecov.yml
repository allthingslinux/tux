# TUX DISCORD BOT - CODECOV CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================
#
# This configuration file defines comprehensive code coverage tracking and
# reporting for the Tux Discord Bot project. It implements tiered coverage
# standards, component-based tracking, and intelligent CI integration.
#
# COVERAGE PHILOSOPHY:
# -------------------
# - Higher standards for critical components (database, core infrastructure)
# - Moderate standards for features and utilities
# - Lower standards for external API wrappers (limited by external dependencies)
# - Strict requirements for new code (patch coverage)
#
# COMPONENT STRUCTURE:
# --------------------
# 1. Core Infrastructure  - Bot startup, event handling (80% target)
# 2. Database Layer       - Data persistence, queries (90% target)
# 3. Bot Commands         - User-facing features (75% target)
# 4. Event Handlers       - Error handling, stability (80% target)
# 5. Utilities           - Helper functions (70% target)
# 6. UI Components       - Discord interface elements (70% target)
# 7. CLI Interface       - Command-line tools (65% target)
# 8. External Wrappers   - Third-party API clients (60% target)
#
# CI INTEGRATION:
# ---------------
# Flags: unit (main tests), database (specific DB tests), integration (e2e tests)
# Reports: Optimized for PR feedback and main branch validation
# Timing: Comments appear after first report for faster feedback
#
# DOCUMENTATION:
# --------------
# Official Codecov docs: https://docs.codecov.com/docs/codecov-yaml
# Company-specific examples: https://github.com/codecov/example-python

# ==============================================================================
# ==============================================================================
# GLOBAL COVERAGE CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================
# Purpose: Defines overall coverage behavior, precision, and display preferences
# Impact: Affects all coverage calculations and visual representations
# ==============================================================================
coverage:
  # PRECISION AND DISPLAY SETTINGS
  # precision: Number of decimal places shown in coverage percentages (0-5)
  # round: How to handle rounding (down = conservative, up = optimistic, nearest = balanced)
  # range: Color coding thresholds for visual coverage indicators (red...green)
  precision: 2
  round: down
  range: 70...100

  # ==============================================================================
  # STATUS CHECKS CONFIGURATION
  # ==============================================================================
  # Purpose: Controls PR status checks and blocking behavior
  # Impact: Determines which changes block merging and which are informational
  # ==============================================================================
  status:
    # GLOBAL STATUS RULES
    # Applied to all status checks unless overridden by specific configurations
    # These settings ensure consistent behavior across all coverage types
    default_rules:
      # flag_coverage_not_uploaded_behavior: How to handle missing flag data
      # exclude = Don't send status if flag data missing (prevents false failures)
      flag_coverage_not_uploaded_behavior: exclude

    # PROJECT-WIDE COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS
    # These checks apply to the entire codebase and determine PR merge eligibility
    project:
      # OVERALL PROJECT COVERAGE
      # Main coverage check that applies to all code changes
      default:
        target: auto  # Compare to base commit (progressive improvement)

      # ========================================================================
      # COMPONENT-SPECIFIC PROJECT COVERAGE
