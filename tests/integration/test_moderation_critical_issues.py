ðŸš¨ Critical Issues Integration Tests - Testing Analysis Findings

Integration tests specifically targeting the critical issues identified in
moderation_analysis.md to ensure they are properly fixed.

Test Coverage:
- Race condition in lock cleanup (Issue #1)
- DM failure preventing action (Issue #2) - FIXED
- Missing bot permission checks (Issue #3) - FIXED
- Database transaction issues (Issue #4)
- User state change race conditions (Issue #5)
- Privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- Data integrity and audit trail gaps

        This test defines the CORRECT behavior: Concurrent operations on same user should be serialized.
        If this test FAILS, it means the current implementation has critical race condition Issue #1.

        Race Condition Scenario from Issue #1:
        - Multiple moderators try to ban the same user simultaneously
        - Lock cleanup happens between check and deletion
        - Memory leaks from uncleared locks

        Thread Safety Requirements:
        - User-specific locks should prevent concurrent operations
        - Lock cleanup should be race-condition-free
        - No memory leaks from abandoned locks
        - Clear error messages for concurrent operation attempts

        CRITICAL: This test should FAIL on current buggy implementation and PASS after fix.
