"""
ðŸš€ LockManager Unit Tests - User Action Locking System

Tests for the LockManager mixin that handles user-specific action locking
to prevent race conditions in concurrent moderation operations.

Test Coverage:
- Lock acquisition and release
- Concurrent operation queuing
- Lock cleanup and memory management
- Race condition prevention
- Timeout handling for queued operations
