# Cursor Commands Specification

## Command Type Classification

| Type | Location | Availability | Management |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Project | `.cursor/commands/` | Current project only | Version controlled |
| Global | `~/.cursor/commands/` | All projects | User-level |
| Team | Dashboard managed | All team members | Admin-controlled |

## File Format Requirements

Commands MUST:

- Use plain Markdown (`.md`) format
- Have descriptive kebab-case filenames
- Contain clear, actionable content
- Be stored in `.cursor/commands/` directory

Commands MUST NOT:

- Use MDC format or YAML frontmatter
- Exceed reasonable length (recommend 200 lines)
- Duplicate functionality of existing commands
- Include sensitive information or secrets

## Invocation

**Syntax**: `/command-name [optional parameters]`

**Behavior**:

- Triggered with `/` prefix in chat input
- Filename (without `.md`) becomes command name
- Auto-discovered and displayed on `/` input
- Parameters passed as additional context

**Example**:

```text
/review-code and check for security issues
```

Command: `review-code`
Parameters: `and check for security issues`

## Command Structure

```markdown
# Title

## Overview
Brief description of command purpose.

## Steps
1. Action one
2. Action two
3. Action three

## Checklist
- [ ] Item one
- [ ] Item two
```

## Content Requirements

Commands SHOULD:

- Start with clear title and overview
- Use step-by-step instructions for workflows
- Include checklists for verification
- Be specific to project workflows
- Focus on repeatability

Commands MAY:

- Reference project-specific tools
- Include code block templates
- Define acceptance criteria
- Link to related documentation

## Naming Conventions

Filenames MUST:

- Use kebab-case: `command-name.md`
- Be descriptive and action-oriented
- Avoid generic names
- Match expected usage pattern

**Good**:

- `review-code.md`
- `create-pr.md`
- `run-tests-and-fix.md`
- `security-audit.md`

**Bad**:

- `command.md`
- `helper.md`
- `tool.md`
- `misc.md`

## Directory Organization

```text
.cursor/commands/
├── code-quality/
│   └── lint.md
├── database/
│   └── migration.md
├── debugging/
│   └── debug.md
└── development/
    └── setup-project.md
```

Commands are organized into subdirectories by domain/category.

## Parameter Handling

Parameters are appended to command content in model context:

- Optional: Commands work with or without parameters
- Freeform: Any text after command name
- Context: Parameters add specificity to command execution

## Team Commands

**Requirements**:

- Created via [Cursor Dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=team-content&section=commands)
- Available only on Team/Enterprise plans
- Automatically synchronized to all team members
- Admin-only creation and modification

**Fields**:

- **Name** (required): Command identifier
- **Description** (optional): Help text for users
- **Content** (required): Markdown command content

**Benefits**:

- Centralized management
- Instant synchronization
- Standardized workflows
- Access control

## Validation Criteria

Commands MUST:

- Be valid Markdown
- Have unique names within scope
- Contain actionable content
- Be project/workflow specific

Commands SHOULD:

- Be tested before committing
- Have clear purpose
- Be updated regularly
- Be documented if complex

## Best Practices

**Scope**:

- One workflow per command
- Clear, focused purpose
- Avoid command overlap

**Content**:

- Action-oriented language
- Specific instructions
- Project context included
- Repeatable process

**Maintenance**:

- Remove unused commands
- Update with workflow changes
- Validate functionality periodically
- Version control project commands

## Command vs Rule

| Aspect | Commands | Rules |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Format | Plain Markdown | MDC with metadata |
| Trigger | Manual `/command` | Automatic/intelligent |
| Purpose | Workflows/actions | Guidelines/standards |
| Scope | User-initiated | Context-applied |
| Location | `.cursor/commands/` | `.cursor/rules/` |
