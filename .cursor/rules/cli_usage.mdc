# Tux CLI Usage

This rule describes the custom `tux` CLI tool used for managing the application.

## Invocation

Commands are run via Poetry: `poetry run tux <options> <command-group> <sub-command>`

## Environment Flags

- **Development (Default):** Commands run in development mode by default (using `.env` variables like `DEV_BOT_TOKEN`, `DEV_DATABASE_URL`). No flag or the `--dev` flag can be used.
- **Production:** To target production resources, **must** use the global `--prod` flag immediately after `tux`: `poetry run tux --prod ...`

See [tux/utils/env.py](mdc:tux/utils/env.py) for environment logic.
