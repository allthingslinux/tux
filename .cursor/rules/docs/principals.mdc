# Documentation Principles & Frameworks

This section covers the fundamental principles and methodologies that guide Tux documentation.

## Diátaxis Documentation Framework

Follow the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework for organizing documentation by user needs:

### Four Documentation Types

- **Tutorials**: Learning-oriented guides that teach users step-by-step
  - Purpose: Help users learn and gain competence
  - Focus: Learning experience, not real work
  - Example: "Getting started with Tux"

- **How-to Guides**: Goal-oriented instructions for specific tasks
  - Purpose: Guide users through problems/tasks they need to solve
  - Focus: Practical solutions, actionable steps
  - Example: "How to configure Tux permissions"

- **Reference**: Information-oriented technical descriptions
  - Purpose: Describe machinery and how to operate it
  - Focus: Factual, authoritative descriptions
  - Example: "Tux API reference", "Configuration schema"

- **Explanation/Concepts**: Understanding-oriented discussions
  - Purpose: Deepen understanding, provide context
  - Focus: Why things work the way do
  - Example: "Why Tux uses this architecture"

### Key Diátaxis Principles

- **User-first**: Address user needs, not just machinery capabilities
- **Clear separation**: Don't mix tutorial, how-to, reference, and explanation content
- **Focus on goals**: How-to guides solve specific user problems
- **Neutral description**: Reference material describes without instructing
- **Flow and sequence**: Structure content for logical user progression
- **Pay attention to naming**: Titles should clearly indicate what/how/why content covers

## Write the Docs Principles

### Content Quality Principles

- **ARID**: Accept (some) repetition - documentation inevitably repeats code logic
- **Skimmable**: Structure for quick scanning - descriptive headings, meaningful link text
- **Exemplary**: Include practical examples for common use cases
- **Consistent**: Use uniform language, formatting, and terminology
- **Current**: Keep documentation updated - outdated docs are worse than missing docs
- **Beautiful**: Intentional visual design and formatting

### Writing Guidelines

- **Participatory**: Include all stakeholders in documentation process
- **Precursory**: Start documenting before development begins
- **Nearby sources**: Store docs close to code they document
- **Unique sources**: Avoid content overlap between different documentation sources
- **Comprehensive**: Cover all likely user questions across all publications

### Content Types

#### FAQs

- **Reflect audience needs**: Base on actual user questions from search/support data
- **Regular updates**: Keep current with user behavior changes
- **Drive to detailed content**: Link to comprehensive guides, not just answer briefly
- **Maintenance plan**: Avoid FAQs becoming outdated parking lots

#### Release Notes

- **Specific changes**: Clearly state what changed
- **Why important**: Explain impact on users (workflow, UI, security, etc.)
- **User goals**: Describe benefits for users
- **Complete information**: Ensure users have everything needed to proceed
- **Visual aids**: Include images when helpful for understanding

#### Error Messages

- **Explicit indication**: Clearly show something went wrong
- **Human voice**: Write conversationally, not robotically
- **No blame**: Be humble, focus on solutions not faults
- **Short & meaningful**: Concise but informative
- **Precise descriptions**: Exactly what went wrong
- **Constructive advice**: Clear steps to fix the problem

### API Documentation

- **Documentation-driven design**: Design APIs through documentation first
- **Test-driven documentation**: Use API tests to generate accurate snippets
- **Machine-readable formats**: Enable interactive docs, mock servers, testing
- **Complete coverage**: Undocumented features don't exist
- **Accurate examples**: Working code samples with expected outputs

### Style Guide Resources

- **Red Hat Style Guide**: <https://redhat-documentation.github.io/supplementary-style-guide/>
- **Write the Docs Guide**: <https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/>

### Accessibility Guidelines

- **Semantic HTML**: Use proper heading hierarchy (h1→h2→h3)
- **Alt text**: Describe images meaningfully for screen readers
- **Color contrast**: Ensure readable text contrast ratios
- **Keyboard navigation**: All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- **Plain language**: Avoid jargon, explain technical terms
- **Consistent navigation**: Predictable page layouts and navigation

### Bias Reduction

- **Inclusive language**: Use gender-neutral terms, avoid stereotypes
- **Geographic neutrality**: Don't assume US-centric perspectives
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Respect diverse backgrounds and experiences
- **Ability-inclusive**: Avoid assumptions about user capabilities
