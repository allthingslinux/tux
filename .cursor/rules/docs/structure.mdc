# Documentation Structure & Organization

The documentation follows a role-based structure organized around user needs:

- **Home**: Main landing page with overview
- **FAQ**: Frequently asked questions with search and snippet search
- **Getting Started**: Onboarding guides for different user types (users, admins, self-hosters, developers)
- **User Guide**: Complete user experience with commands and features
- **Admin Guide**: Server administration and configuration
- **Self-Hoster Guide**: Installation, configuration, and management
- **Developer Guide**: Complete development resources and best practices
- **Reference**: Technical specifications, API docs, CLI, environment variables
- **Changelog**: Version history and release notes

Navigation is handled by the `mkdocs-literate-nav` plugin using `SUMMARY.md` with wildcard patterns.

## Content Organization and Structure

### Directory Structure

- **Source directory**: `content/` (all markdown source files)
- **Build directory**: `site/` (MkDocs output, served by development server)
- **Navigation file**: `content/SUMMARY.md` (literate navigation with wildcards)
- **Home page**: `content/index.md` (main landing page)
- **Includes**: `includes/` directory for shared content (abbreviations)
- **Overrides**: `overrides/` directory for theme customizations

### Literate Navigation Organization

Content follows a user-centric structure with Diátaxis principles and is organized using SUMMARY.md:

#### Core Sections

- **`getting-started/`**: Onboarding guides for different user types
- **`user/`**: Complete user guide with commands and features
- **`admin/`**: Server administration, setup, configuration, and management
- **`selfhost/`**: Self-hosting with installation, configuration, and management
- **`developer/`**: Development resources, tutorials, guides, concepts, and best practices
- **`reference/`**: Technical specifications, API docs, CLI, environment variables, troubleshooting
- **`community/`**: Community resources, changelog, FAQ, support, and feedback

#### Special Directories

- **`assets/`**: Static files organized by type (images, stylesheets, javascript)
- **`overrides/`**: MkDocs theme customizations (main.html, partials)
- **`plugins/`**: Custom MkDocs plugins (tux plugin)

### Automation Integration

- **Auto-generated API docs**: `reference/src/` (mkdocstrings + api-autonav)
- **Coverage reports**: `reference/coverage.md` (integrated test coverage)
- **Snippet extraction**: `reference/snippet-search.md` (code snippet search)
- **Social cards**: Auto-generated for all pages with custom backgrounds
- **Spell checking**: Multi-backend spellcheck with custom word lists
- **Custom plugins**: Tux plugin available for enhanced documentation features

### File Naming Conventions

- **Files**: `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `moderation-commands.md`, `bot-lifecycle.md`)
- **Directories**: `kebab-case/` (e.g., `getting-started/`, `developer/`)
- **Index files**: `index.md` in every directory (provides section overview)
- **Assets**: Organized by type in subdirectories (`images/`, `stylesheets/`, `javascript/`)

### Content Hierarchy

Each major section follows this pattern with literate navigation wildcards:

```text
section-name/
├── index.md              # Section overview and navigation
├── subtopic-1/
│   ├── index.md         # Subtopic overview
│   ├── specific-page.md # Detailed content
│   └── another-page.md
├── subtopic-2/
│   ├── index.md         # Subtopic overview
│   ├── nested-page.md   # Detailed content
│   └── another-nested.md
├── standalone-page.md   # Direct content (no subfolder needed)
└── another-standalone.md
```

### Hierarchy Examples

**With subdirectories** (admin, selfhost, developer):

- `admin/setup/` → Inviting bot, initial config files
- `admin/configuration/` → Bot settings, permissions, features, advanced config
- `selfhost/install/` → Requirements, Docker, system setup, first run
- `selfhost/config/` → Bot token, environment variables, database setup
- `selfhost/manage/` → Monitoring, backups, updates, performance, security, logging, migrations
- `developer/tutorials/` → Step-by-step development guides (wildcard: `developer/tutorials/*.md`)
- `developer/concepts/` → Complex architectural topics with nested subdirectories (wildcard: `developer/concepts/*.md`)
- `developer/best-practices/` → Code review, documentation, git workflow, CI/CD, testing
- `reference/troubleshooting/` → User, admin, selfhost, developer specific issues

**With nested subdirectories** (developer concepts):

- `developer/concepts/core/` → Bot lifecycle, cog system, command system, permission system, configuration system, service layer, hot reload, error handling, logging
- `developer/concepts/database/` → Database architecture, models, controllers, migrations, service layer, testing
- `developer/concepts/ui/` → Buttons, embeds, modals, views
- `developer/concepts/handlers/` → Hot reload system
- `developer/concepts/services/` → Service layer architecture
- `developer/concepts/wrappers/` → Service wrappers and utilities
- `developer/concepts/tasks/` → Task monitor integration

**With standalone pages** (reference, community):

- `reference/cli.md` → CLI command reference
- `reference/env.md` → Environment variables reference
- `reference/coverage.md` → Test coverage report
- `reference/versioning.md` → Versioning and release information
- `community/faq.md` → Frequently asked questions
- `community/support.md` → Support and contact information
- `community/feedback.md` → Community feedback and contribution

### Adding New Content

1. **Choose location**: Determine target audience and topic based on Diátaxis principles
2. **Create structure**: Add `index.md` for new sections/subsections with implicit indexes
3. **Update navigation**: Modify `content/SUMMARY.md` to include new pages using wildcards where appropriate
4. **Add assets**: Place images in `content/assets/images/`, styles in `content/assets/stylesheets/`

### Asset Organization

- **Images**: `content/assets/images/` (logos, screenshots, diagrams with index pages)
- **Stylesheets**: `content/assets/stylesheets/` (custom CSS with extra.css, material.css, mkdocstrings.css, pymdownx.css)
- **JavaScript**: `content/assets/javascript/` (custom JS with extra.js)
- **Known Words**: `content/assets/known_words.txt` (spellcheck dictionary)

### Navigation Structure

Navigation is handled by the `mkdocs-literate-nav` plugin using `content/SUMMARY.md`:

- **Wildcard patterns**: `developer/tutorials/*.md` automatically includes all tutorial files
- **Implicit indexes**: Automatic index page generation for directories without explicit index.md
- **Hierarchical structure**: Top-level sections with nested subsections
- **User journey ordering**: Getting started → User → Admin → Self-host → Developer → Reference → Community
- **Breadcrumb navigation**: Automatic breadcrumb trails with customizable delimiters
- **Backlinks**: Digital garden-style linking between related pages
