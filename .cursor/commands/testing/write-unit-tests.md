# Write Unit Tests

## Overview

Create comprehensive unit tests for the current code and generate the test file with proper imports and setup according to the project's testing conventions.

## Steps

1. **Test Coverage**
    - Test all public methods and functions
    - Cover edge cases and error conditions
    - Test both positive and negative scenarios
    - Aim for high code coverage
2. **Test Structure**
    - Use the project's testing framework conventions
    - Write clear, descriptive test names
    - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
    - Group related tests logically
3. **Test Cases to Include**
    - Happy path scenarios
    - Edge cases and boundary conditions
    - Error handling and exception cases
    - Mock external dependencies appropriately
4. **Test Quality**
    - Make tests independent and isolated
    - Ensure tests are deterministic and repeatable
    - Keep tests simple and focused on one thing
    - Add helpful assertion messages

## Error Handling

If tests fail:

- Review error messages and tracebacks
- Check fixture setup and teardown
- Verify database state if using database fixtures
- Ensure async tests use @pytest.mark.asyncio
