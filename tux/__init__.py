Tux Discord Bot Package Initialization.

This module handles version detection for the Tux Discord bot using a robust
fallback strategy that works across different deployment scenarios including
development, Docker containers, and PyPI installations.

Notes
-----
The version detection follows this priority order:
1. TUX_VERSION environment variable (runtime override)
2. VERSION file (Docker builds and deployments)
3. Git tags (development environments)
4. Package metadata (PyPI installations)
5. Fallback to "dev" if all methods fail

This approach ensures reliable version reporting regardless of how the bot
is deployed or executed.

    Retrieve the application version using multiple fallback strategies.

    This function attempts to determine the version using several methods in
    priority order, ensuring version detection works in all deployment scenarios.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The detected version string, or "dev" if detection fails.

    Notes
    -----
    Fallback Strategy:
        1. Environment variable (TUX_VERSION) - Allows runtime version override
        2. VERSION file - Created during Docker builds for consistent versioning
        3. Git describe - Uses git tags for development environments
        4. Package metadata - Standard approach for PyPI installations
        5. "dev" fallback - Ensures a version is always returned

    This function is designed to never raise exceptions. All errors are
    silently handled to ensure the application can start even if version
    detection encounters issues.
