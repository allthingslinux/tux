    # CONTAINER IDENTIFICATION
    # Development-specific name to avoid conflicts with production containers
    # Clearly identifies this as a development instance
    container_name: tux-dev

    # IMAGE CONFIGURATION
    # Uses local development image built from dev stage of Dockerfile
    # Contains development tools, debugging utilities, and additional packages
    image: tux:dev

    # BUILD CONFIGURATION
    # Always builds from local source for development
    # Uses development target with full tooling and debugging capabilities
    build:
      # Build context includes entire project directory
      context: .
      # Dockerfile location (standard)
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      # Target development stage with debugging tools and dev dependencies
      target: dev

    # DEVELOPMENT OVERRIDE COMMAND
    # Skip prisma generate in CMD to avoid read-only filesystem issues
    # Can be run manually after container starts
    command:
      - sh

    # DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW CONFIGURATION
    # Docker BuildKit watch feature for live development
    # Provides real-time code synchronization and intelligent rebuilds
    develop:
      # WATCH CONFIGURATION
      # Monitors filesystem changes and syncs/rebuilds as appropriate
      # Optimizes development workflow with minimal container restarts
      watch:
        # FILE SYNCHRONIZATION (Hot Reload)
        # Syncs code changes without rebuilding the container
        # Fastest feedback loop for code changes
        - action: sync
          # Watch entire project directory
          path: .
          # Sync to app directory in container
          target: /app/
          # IGNORE PATTERNS
          # Excludes files that don't need syncing or would cause issues
          # Performance optimization to reduce sync overhead
          ignore:
            # Cache directories (not needed in sync)
            - .cache/
            # IDE configurations (not needed in container)
            - .idea/

            - '*.swp'
            - .*.swp
            - '*~'

        # DEPENDENCY REBUILD TRIGGERS
        # Files that require full container rebuild when changed
        # These changes affect the environment setup and need fresh build

        # Python dependencies changed - rebuild required
        - action: rebuild
          path: pyproject.toml

        # Lock file updated - rebuild required for dependency consistency
        - action: rebuild
          path: poetry.lock

        # Database schema changes - rebuild required for Prisma client generation
        - action: rebuild
          path: prisma/schema/

    # VOLUME MOUNTS
    # Development-specific volumes with different naming to avoid production conflicts
    # Focuses on persistence of development data without read-only restrictions
    volumes:
      # DEVELOPMENT CACHE VOLUME
      # Separate cache volume for development to avoid conflicts with production
      # Contains development-specific cache data and temporary files
      - tux_dev_cache:/app/.cache

      # DEVELOPMENT TEMPORARY VOLUME
      # Separate temporary volume for development work
      # Used for development artifacts, debugging files, etc.
      - tux_dev_temp:/app/temp

      # USER HOME VOLUME
      # Single volume for all user cache/config directories (.cache, .npm, etc.)
      # Prevents read-only filesystem errors and covers all CLI tools
      - tux_dev_user_home:/home/nonroot

    # ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
    # Environment variables loaded from .env file
    # Same as production but may contain different values for development
    # DEVELOPMENT: May include debug flags, development database URLs, etc.
    env_file:
      - .env

    # RESTART POLICY
    # Automatic restart for development convenience
    # Helps maintain development environment during crashes and testing
    restart: unless-stopped

    # RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
    # Higher resource limits for development workloads
    # Development often requires more resources for compilation, debugging, etc.
    deploy:
      resources:
        # RESOURCE LIMITS (Development)
        # Higher limits to accommodate development tools and processes
        limits:
          memory: 1g  # Maximum 1GB RAM (double production)
          cpus: '1.0'  # Maximum 1 full CPU core (double production)

        # RESOURCE RESERVATIONS (Development)
        # Higher reservations for better development performance
        reservations:
          memory: 512m  # Guaranteed 512MB RAM (double production)
          cpus: '0.5'  # Guaranteed 0.5 CPU cores (double production)

    # LOGGING CONFIGURATION
    # Same logging setup as production for consistency
    # Helps developers understand production logging behavior
    logging:
      # JSON structured logging for development log analysis
      driver: json-file

      # Log rotation to prevent development disk space issues
      options:
        max-size: 10m  # Rotate logs when they reach 10MB
        max-file: '3'  # Keep maximum 3 rotated log files
# ==============================================================================
# VOLUMES CONFIGURATION - DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
# ==============================================================================
# Development-specific named volumes to avoid conflicts with production
# These volumes are isolated from production and can be safely removed
# for clean development environment resets
# ==============================================================================
volumes:
  # DEVELOPMENT CACHE VOLUME
  # Stores development-specific cache data
  # Contains: Development API cache, debug cache, test data, etc.
  # Isolation: Completely separate from production cache
  # Lifecycle: Can be reset anytime for clean development environment
  tux_dev_cache:
    driver: local  # Local Docker volume driver (default)

  # DEVELOPMENT TEMPORARY VOLUME
  # Stores development temporary files and artifacts
  # Contains: Debug files, development logs, test artifacts, etc.
  # Isolation: Separate from production temporary data
  # Lifecycle: Safe to clear for clean development state
  tux_dev_temp:
    driver: local  # Local Docker volume driver (default)

  # DEVELOPMENT USER HOME VOLUME
  # Stores all user cache and config directories
  # Contains: .cache (Prisma), .npm, .config, and other CLI tool data
  # Isolation: Separate from production user data
  # Lifecycle: Persistent to avoid re-downloading tools and cache
  tux_dev_user_home:
    driver: local  # Local Docker volume driver (default)

# DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED
# ==============================================================================
#
# 1. LIVE DEVELOPMENT:
#    - Real-time code synchronization with Docker BuildKit watch
#    - Intelligent rebuild triggers for dependency changes
#    - Optimized ignore patterns for performance
#    - Hot reload for rapid iteration
#
# 2. DEVELOPMENT ISOLATION:
#    - Separate container name and volumes from production
#    - Development-specific image with debugging tools
#    - Isolated environment that doesn't affect production
#
# 3. RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION:
#    - Higher resource limits for development workloads
#    - Adequate resources for compilation and debugging
#    - Performance optimized for development tasks
#
# 4. WORKFLOW EFFICIENCY:
#    - Automatic restart for development convenience
#    - Easy shell access for debugging and development
#    - Consistent logging with production for familiarity
#
# 5. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:
#    - Automatic rebuilds on dependency file changes
#    - Schema change detection for database updates
#    - Smart rebuild triggers to minimize wait time
#
# DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW:
# ---------------------
# 1. Start development environment:
#    docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
#
# 2. Edit code - changes sync automatically
#    (No restart needed for code changes)
#
# 3. Update dependencies in pyproject.toml:
#    (Container rebuilds automatically)
#
# 4. Debug with shell access:
#    docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec tux bash
#
# 5. View logs:
#    docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f tux
#
# 6. Clean restart:
#    docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
#    docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
#
# ==============================================================================
