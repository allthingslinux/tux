## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

### Source Code

- `tux/`: The main package containing the bot code.
  - `cogs/`: The cogs directory containing categorized hybrid, prefix and slash commands/command groups. See [Cogs Primer](#cogs-primer) for more information.
  - `database/`: The database directory containing the database client and controllers. See [Database Primer](#database-primer) for more information.

- `renovate.json`: The Renovate configuration file containing the dependency update settings for the bot.

## Cogs Primer

There comes a point in your botâ€™s development when you want to organize a collection of commands, listeners, and some state into one class. Cogs allow you to do just that.

It should be noted that cogs are typically used alongside with Extensions.

An extension at its core is a python file with an entry point called setup. This setup function must be a Python coroutine. It takes a single parameter of the Bot that loads the extension.

With regards to Tux, we typically define one cog per extension. This allows us to keep our code organized and modular.

Furthermore, we have a `CogLoader` class that loads our cogs (technically, extensions) from the `cogs` directory and registers them with the bot at startup.

### Cog Essentials

- Each cog is a Python class that subclasses commands.Cog.
- Every regular command or "prefix" is marked with the `@commands.command()` decorator.
- Every app or "slash" command is marked with the `@app_commands.command()` decorator.
- Every hybrid command is marked with the `@commands.hybrid_command()` decorator.
- Every listener is marked with the `@commands.Cog.listener()` decorator.

tl;dr - Extensions are imported "modules", cogs are classes that are subclasses of `commands.Cog`.
