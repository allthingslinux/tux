# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves redesigning the database schema for an all-in-one Discord bot using discord.py, SQLModel as the ORM, and Alembic for migrations. The goal is to create a maintainable, scalable, professional, high-performing database schema that covers typical Discord bot functionality while following best practices.

Based on analysis of existing Discord bot projects in the workspace, the new schema needs to support common Discord bot features including user management, guild configuration, moderation, entertainment features, logging, and premium functionality. The design incorporates modern architecture patterns with controllers, services, Redis caching, and comprehensive mixin systems.
