# ADR-004: Database Access Patterns

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The current database access patterns in the Tux Discord bot show several issues:

- Direct database queries scattered throughout cogs
- Inconsistent transaction handling across operations
- Lack of proper error recovery mechanisms
- No caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- Mixed concerns between data access and business logic
- Difficult to test database operations in isolation

While the BaseController provides good abstraction, the usage patterns create coupling and maintainability issues. The system needs consistent, testable database access patterns that support performance optimization and proper error handling.

## Decision

Implement the Repository pattern with Unit of Work for database access:

1. **Repository Interfaces**: Abstract data access operations behind interfaces
2. **Unit of Work Pattern**: Manage transactions and coordinate multiple repositories
3. **Domain Models**: Separate domain objects from database entities
4. **Caching Layer**: Implement strategic caching for performance optimization
5. **Query Optimization**: Centralize and optimize common query patterns

## Rationale

The Repository pattern was chosen because it:

- Provides clean abstraction over data access
- Enables easy testing through interface mocking
- Centralizes query logic for optimization
- Supports multiple data sources if needed
- Follows established enterprise patterns

Unit of Work complements repositories by:

- Managing transaction boundaries properly
- Coordinating changes across multiple repositories
- Providing consistent error handling and rollback
- Supporting complex business operations

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Keep Current Controller Pattern

- Description: Continue using existing BaseController with direct access
- Pros: No refactoring required, familiar to team
- Cons: Tight coupling, difficult testing, scattered query logic
- Why rejected: Doesn't address testability and coupling issues

### Alternative 2: Active Record Pattern

- Description: Embed data access methods directly in domain models
- Pros: Simple to understand, less abstraction
- Cons: Tight coupling between domain and data access, difficult to test
- Why rejected: Creates coupling between domain logic and persistence

### Alternative 3: Data Mapper with ORM Only

- Description: Rely solely on Prisma ORM without additional patterns
- Pros: Simple, leverages existing ORM capabilities
- Cons: Business logic mixed with data access, difficult to optimize queries
- Why rejected: Doesn't provide sufficient abstraction for complex operations

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clean separation between data access and business logic
- Improved testability through interface abstraction
- Better query optimization through centralization
- Consistent transaction handling across operations
- Enhanced performance through strategic caching

### Negative

- Requires significant refactoring of existing data access code
- Increased complexity for simple CRUD operations
- Team needs to learn repository and unit of work patterns
- Additional abstraction layers may impact performance

### Neutral

- Changes to data access patterns throughout codebase
- New interface definitions and implementations
- Updated testing strategies for data operations

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Define repository interfaces for major entities:
   - `IUserRepository`
   - `IGuildRepository`
   - `ICaseRepository`
   - `ISnippetRepository`

2. Create Unit of Work interface and implementation
3. Implement base repository with common operations
4. Set up dependency injection for repositories

### Phase 2: Repository Implementations

1. Implement concrete repositories using existing controllers
2. Add query optimization and batching capabilities
3. Implement caching layer for frequently accessed data
4. Create repository-specific error handling

### Phase 3: Service Integration

1. Update services to use repositories instead of direct database access
2. Implement Unit of Work in complex business operations
3. Add transaction management to service layer
4. Create data access middleware for common patterns

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization

1. Implement strategic caching for read-heavy operations
2. Add query batching for bulk operations
3. Optimize database queries based on usage patterns
4. Add performance monitoring for data access operations

### Success Criteria

- All data access goes through repository interfaces
- Complex operations use Unit of Work for transaction management
- Data access is independently testable without database
- Performance meets or exceeds current benchmarks

## Compliance

### Code Review Guidelines

- Direct database access outside repositories is prohibited
- All repositories must implement defined interfaces
- Complex operations must use Unit of Work pattern
- Caching strategies must be documented and justified

### Automated Checks

- Linting rules to detect direct database access in services/cogs
- Interface compliance testing for repositories
- Performance tests for critical data access paths

### Documentation Requirements

- Repository interface documentation with examples
- Unit of Work usage patterns
- Caching strategy documentation
- Query optimization guidelines

- [ADR-001](001-dependency-injection-strategy.md): Dependency Injection Strategy
- [ADR-003](003-error-handling-standardization.md): Error Handling Standardization
- Requirements 4.1, 4.4, 4.5, 3.2

## Notes

This pattern provides a solid foundation for scalable data access while maintaining the benefits of the existing Prisma ORM. Implementation should focus on the most frequently used entities first.
