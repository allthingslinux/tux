# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive dependency injection system for the Tux Discord bot. The system will eliminate 35+ direct database instantiations across the codebase, enable modern architectural patterns, improve testability, and reduce tight coupling between components. The implementation will maintain backward compatibility while providing a foundation for future architectural improvements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized service container that manages object lifecycles, so that I can eliminate direct instantiations and improve code maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service container is initialized THEN it SHALL support singleton, transient, and scoped service lifetimes
2. WHEN a service is registered THEN the container SHALL store the service descriptor with its implementation type and lifetime
3. WHEN a service is requested THEN the container SHALL automatically resolve dependencies through constructor injection
4. WHEN a singleton service is requested multiple times THEN the container SHALL return the same instance
5. IF a service is not registered THEN the container SHALL raise a clear error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-defined service interfaces, so that I can write testable code with proper abstractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service interfaces are defined THEN they SHALL use Python protocols for type safety
2. WHEN the database service interface is implemented THEN it SHALL provide methods for getting controllers and executing queries
3. WHEN the bot service interface is implemented THEN it SHALL provide methods for accessing bot properties and operations
4. WHEN the config service interface is implemented THEN it SHALL provide methods for accessing configuration values
5. IF an interface method is called THEN it SHALL have proper type hints and documentation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want concrete service implementations that wrap existing functionality, so that I can maintain backward compatibility while introducing dependency injection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the DatabaseService is implemented THEN it SHALL wrap the existing DatabaseController
2. WHEN the BotService is implemented THEN it SHALL provide access to bot latency, users, and emojis
3. WHEN the ConfigService is implemented THEN it SHALL provide access to configuration values
4. WHEN any service is instantiated THEN it SHALL not break existing functionality
5. IF a service method is called THEN it SHALL delegate to the appropriate underlying implementation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a service registry that configures all services, so that I have a central place to manage service registration and configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service registry is used THEN it SHALL configure all core services as singletons
2. WHEN the bot instance is provided THEN the registry SHALL register bot-dependent services
3. WHEN services are registered THEN they SHALL be properly typed with their interfaces
4. WHEN the container is configured THEN it SHALL be ready for dependency injection
5. IF registration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an enhanced base cog class with dependency injection support, so that all cogs can benefit from the new architecture without breaking existing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a cog inherits from BaseCog THEN it SHALL automatically receive injected services
2. WHEN the container is available THEN services SHALL be injected through the container
3. WHEN the container is not available THEN the cog SHALL fall back to direct instantiation for backward compatibility
4. WHEN services are injected THEN they SHALL be accessible through standard properties
5. IF injection fails THEN the cog SHALL still function with fallback services

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the bot to initialize the dependency injection container during startup, so that all cogs can use the injected services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bot starts up THEN it SHALL initialize the service container before loading cogs
2. WHEN the container is initialized THEN it SHALL be configured with all required services
3. WHEN cogs are loaded THEN they SHALL have access to the initialized container
4. WHEN initialization fails THEN the bot SHALL log appropriate error messages and handle gracefully
5. IF the container is not available THEN cogs SHALL still function with fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate existing cogs to use dependency injection, so that I can eliminate direct database instantiations and improve testability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a cog is migrated THEN it SHALL inherit from BaseCog instead of commands.Cog
2. WHEN direct instantiations are removed THEN the cog SHALL use injected services
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the cog SHALL maintain all existing functionality
4. WHEN services are unavailable THEN the cog SHALL fall back to direct instantiation
5. IF migration introduces bugs THEN they SHALL be caught by existing tests

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing support for the dependency injection system, so that I can write unit tests with proper mocking and verify system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing unit tests THEN I SHALL be able to mock services easily
2. WHEN testing cogs THEN I SHALL be able to inject mock services through the container
3. WHEN running integration tests THEN the full dependency injection system SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN measuring performance THEN service resolution SHALL be fast and efficient
5. IF tests fail THEN they SHALL provide clear information about what went wrong

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to maintain backward compatibility, so that existing code continues to work during and after the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependency injection is not available THEN cogs SHALL fall back to direct instantiation
2. WHEN existing properties are accessed THEN they SHALL continue to work as expected
3. WHEN the migration is incomplete THEN mixed usage patterns SHALL be supported
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL not break the entire bot
5. IF compatibility is broken THEN it SHALL be detected by existing tests

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear success metrics and validation tools, so that I can verify the implementation meets its goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the implementation is complete THEN zero direct DatabaseController instantiations SHALL remain in cogs
2. WHEN all cogs are migrated THEN 100% SHALL inherit from BaseCog
3. WHEN performance is measured THEN there SHALL be no degradation in bot startup time
4. WHEN boilerplate is measured THEN there SHALL be a 90% reduction in repetitive code
5. IF metrics don't meet targets THEN the implementation SHALL be refined until they do
