# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create branch analysis script with dependency detection
  - Write a Python script that shows the 29 files changed in misc/kaizen commit
  - Parse git diff --stat output to show change statistics per file
  - Analyze import statements and references between the changed files to detect dependencies
  - Identify potential dependency hotspots (files that many others depend on)
  - Group files into logical categories based on file paths and dependency relationships
  - Display the analysis showing both suggested groupings and dependency warnings
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Add interactive file grouping with dependency analysis
  - Create simple CLI prompts to assign files to named groups
  - Show the suggested groups and let user modify them
  - Analyze import statements and file references to detect potential dependencies
  - Warn user when files with dependencies are assigned to different groups
  - Allow creating custom group names and moving files between groups
  - Provide options to handle dependencies: duplicate files across groups or merge groups
  - Ensure all 29 files are assigned before proceeding
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Implement branch creation from groups with dependency handling
  - Create backup branch (misc/kaizen-backup)
  - Reset misc/kaizen to before the large commit (keeping file changes)
  - For each group, selectively add files and create focused commits
  - Handle cross-dependencies by either duplicating necessary changes or creating dependency order
  - Validate that each branch can build/run independently or document required merge order
  - Create separate branches for each group with descriptive names
  - Generate dependency notes for PR descriptions explaining merge order if needed
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 4. Generate PR preparation commands
  - Output git push commands for each created branch
  - Generate suggested PR titles and descriptions for each group
  - Create a summary of what branches were created and their purpose
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.4_
