# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a systematic workflow for breaking up large, unfocused branches with scattered changes into multiple focused pull requests. The workflow is specifically designed to handle branches with single large commits containing many unrelated changes, helping developers organize file changes by logical groupings, create clean feature branches with focused commits, and maintain a clear git history while preserving all changes from the original branch.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze my single large commit to understand what file changes exist, so that I can plan how to split them logically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the branch analysis THEN the system SHALL display a summary of all modified files grouped by directory/component
2. WHEN I run the branch analysis THEN the system SHALL show the diff statistics for each file (lines added/removed)
3. WHEN I run the branch analysis THEN the system SHALL identify potential logical groupings based on file paths, types, and change patterns
4. IF there are more than 20 modified files THEN the system SHALL provide a condensed view with expandable sections
5. WHEN analyzing a single commit THEN the system SHALL parse file changes rather than commit history

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interactively group my changes into logical chunks, so that each chunk can become a focused PR.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I review the analysis THEN the system SHALL allow me to create named groups for related changes
2. WHEN I create a group THEN the system SHALL allow me to assign specific files or commits to that group
3. WHEN I assign changes to groups THEN the system SHALL validate that no changes are left unassigned
4. WHEN I finalize groupings THEN the system SHALL show a summary of each proposed PR with its scope

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically create clean feature branches from my groupings, so that I don't have to manually apply partial changes from my large commit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I confirm my groupings THEN the system SHALL create a new branch for each group
2. WHEN creating branches THEN the system SHALL use descriptive names based on the group names
3. WHEN creating branches from a single large commit THEN the system SHALL apply only the file changes assigned to each group
4. WHEN applying partial changes THEN the system SHALL create new focused commits with descriptive messages
5. IF conflicts arise during change application THEN the system SHALL pause and provide guidance for resolution

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve my original branch while creating the split branches, so that I have a backup of my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the splitting process starts THEN the system SHALL create a backup branch with timestamp
2. WHEN all split branches are created THEN the system SHALL verify that all changes are preserved across the new branches
3. WHEN the process completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary showing the original branch and all created branches
4. IF any changes are lost during splitting THEN the system SHALL alert the user and halt the process

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that my split branches are ready for PR creation, so that I can confidently submit them for review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN split branches are created THEN the system SHALL run basic validation checks on each branch
2. WHEN validating branches THEN the system SHALL check that each branch builds successfully
3. WHEN validating branches THEN the system SHALL verify that tests pass for each branch
4. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL provide a checklist of next steps for each PR

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate PR templates and descriptions for each split branch, so that I can quickly create well-documented pull requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN branches are validated THEN the system SHALL generate PR titles based on the group names and changes
2. WHEN generating PR descriptions THEN the system SHALL include a summary of changes and affected components
3. WHEN generating PR descriptions THEN the system SHALL reference related commits and their messages
4. WHEN PR templates are ready THEN the system SHALL provide commands or links to create the actual PRs
