# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for creating a priority implementation roadmap based on the comprehensive codebase audit analysis. The goal is to analyze the 70+ audit files containing insights, recommendations, and improvement strategies to create a structured, prioritized todo list of the most impactful features and improvements to implement. This is an information analysis and synthesis task that will produce strategic guidance without making actual code changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want a comprehensive analysis of all audit findings, so that I can understand the full scope of identified improvements and their relative importance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL process all 70+ audit files in the audit directory
2. WHEN processing audit files THEN the system SHALL extract key findings, recommendations, and improvement suggestions from each file
3. WHEN extracting insights THEN the system SHALL categorize findings by type (architecture, performance, security, code quality, developer experience, etc)
4. WHEN categorizing findings THEN the system SHALL identify recurring themes and patterns across multiple audit files
5. IF duplicate or overlapping recommendations exist THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into unified improvement items

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want findings prioritized by impact and effort, so that I can make informed decisions about implementation order and resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing each finding THEN the system SHALL assess the business impact (high, medium, low)
2. WHEN assessing impact THEN the system SHALL consider factors including user experience improvement, developer productivity gains, system reliability enhancement, and technical debt reduction
3. WHEN analyzing each finding THEN the system SHALL estimate implementation effort (high, medium, low)
4. WHEN estimating effort THEN the system SHALL consider factors including complexity, dependencies, risk level, and required resources
5. WHEN both impact and effort are assessed THEN the system SHALL calculate a priority score for each improvement item
6. IF an improvement has high impact and low effort THEN it SHALL be classified as high priority
7. IF an improvement has high impact and high effort THEN it SHALL be classified as medium priority
8. IF an improvement has low impact regardless of effort THEN it SHALL be classified as low priority

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a technical architect, I want improvements grouped by implementation phases, so that I can plan a logical sequence of changes that build upon each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the roadmap THEN the system SHALL group improvements into logical implementation phases
2. WHEN grouping improvements THEN the system SHALL ensure foundational changes are scheduled before dependent improvements
3. WHEN defining phases THEN the system SHALL consider technical dependencies between improvements
4. WHEN organizing phases THEN the system SHALL balance quick wins with long-term architectural improvements
5. IF an improvement depends on another THEN the dependent improvement SHALL be placed in a later phase
6. WHEN creating phases THEN each phase SHALL have a clear theme and objective

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want detailed context for each improvement item, so that I can understand the rationale and implementation approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting each improvement THEN the system SHALL include the original audit source references
2. WHEN describing improvements THEN the system SHALL provide clear problem statements and proposed solutions
3. WHEN documenting improvements THEN the system SHALL include relevant code examples or patterns from the audit
4. WHEN specifying improvements THEN the system SHALL reference specific files, functions, or patterns that need modification
5. IF multiple audit files mention the same issue THEN the system SHALL consolidate all relevant context and references
6. WHEN providing context THEN the system SHALL include quantitative metrics where available (e.g., "affects 40+ cog files")

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want success metrics and expected outcomes defined for each improvement, so that I can measure the value delivered by implementation efforts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining each improvement THEN the system SHALL specify measurable success criteria
2. WHEN specifying success criteria THEN the system SHALL include quantitative targets where possible
3. WHEN documenting improvements THEN the system SHALL estimate the expected benefits (performance gains, code reduction, etc.)
4. WHEN providing metrics THEN the system SHALL reference baseline measurements from the audit where available
5. IF the audit provides specific improvement targets THEN those SHALL be included in the roadmap
6. WHEN documenting outcomes THEN the system SHALL specify both technical and business benefits

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project coordinator, I want resource and timeline estimates for each improvement, so that I can plan capacity and coordinate with other initiatives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting each improvement THEN the system SHALL provide effort estimates in person-weeks or person-months
2. WHEN estimating effort THEN the system SHALL consider the scope and complexity indicated in the audit findings
3. WHEN providing estimates THEN the system SHALL include both development and testing effort
4. WHEN specifying timelines THEN the system SHALL account for dependencies between improvements
5. IF the audit provides specific timeline recommendations THEN those SHALL be incorporated into the roadmap
6. WHEN estimating resources THEN the system SHALL specify required skill sets and expertise levels

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance lead, I want risk assessments for each improvement, so that I can plan appropriate testing and validation strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting each improvement THEN the system SHALL assess implementation risks (high, medium, low)
2. WHEN assessing risks THEN the system SHALL consider factors including system stability impact, complexity, and dependencies
3. WHEN identifying risks THEN the system SHALL reference specific concerns mentioned in the audit files
4. WHEN documenting risks THEN the system SHALL suggest mitigation strategies based on audit recommendations
5. IF the audit identifies specific risk factors THEN those SHALL be highlighted in the roadmap
6. WHEN providing risk assessments THEN the system SHALL include both technical and business risks

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a development team, I want the roadmap formatted as an actionable document, so that we can easily track progress and implementation status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the roadmap THEN the system SHALL format it as a structured markdown document
2. WHEN structuring the document THEN the system SHALL use clear headings, sections, and formatting for readability
3. WHEN presenting improvements THEN the system SHALL use consistent formatting and organization
4. WHEN documenting items THEN the system SHALL include checkboxes or status indicators for tracking
5. WHEN organizing content THEN the system SHALL provide both summary views and detailed breakdowns
6. WHEN formatting the roadmap THEN the system SHALL ensure it can be easily converted to other formats (PDF, presentations, etc.)
