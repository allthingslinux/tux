# Priority Implementation Roadmap Templates

This directory contains structured templates for systematically analyzing the 70+ audit files and generating a priority implementation roadmap.

## Template Overview

### 1. File Review Template (`file_review_template.md`)
**Purpose**: Systematically review each audit file to extract actionable insights and recommendations.

**Usage**: Use this template for each of the 70+ audit files to ensure consistent data extraction.

**Key Sections**:
- File categorization (Analysis/Implementation/Configuration/Executive/Strategy)
- Key insights extraction
- Recommendations capture
- Quantitative data recording
- Implementation details
- Source references

### 2. Improvement Item Template (`improvement_item_template.md`)
**Purpose**: Record extracted insights in a standardized format for analysis and prioritization.

**Usage**: Create one improvement item document for each unique improvement identified across all audit files.

**Key Sections**:
- Detailed improvement description
- Category classification
- Source file references
- Affected components
- Problem statement and proposed solution
- Success metrics and dependencies
- Risk factors and implementation notes

### 3. Assessment Template (`assessment_template.md`)
**Purpose**: Evaluate each improvement using standardized criteria for business impact and implementation effort.

**Usage**: Complete one assessment for each improvement item using the 1-10 scoring system.

**Key Sections**:
- Impact assessment (User Experience, Developer Productivity, System Reliability, Technical Debt Reduction)
- Effort assessment (Technical Complexity, Dependencies, Risk Level, Resource Requirements)
- Priority calculation and classification
- Assessment notes and confidence levels

### 4. Consolidation Template (`consolidation_template.md`)
**Purpose**: Group related findings and eliminate duplicates across multiple audit files.

**Usage**: Use when multiple audit files contain related insights that should be combined into a single improvement item.

**Key Sections**:
- Theme identification
- Related insights compilation
- Unified description creation
- Source traceability maintenance
- Deduplication record keeping

## Workflow Integration

These templates support the following workflow:

1. **File Review Phase**: Use `file_review_template.md` for each audit file
2. **Data Collection Phase**: Use `improvement_item_template.md` for each unique improvement
3. **Consolidation Phase**: Use `consolidation_template.md` to merge related improvements
4. **Assessment Phase**: Use `assessment_template.md` to evaluate and prioritize improvements

## Quality Assurance

Each template includes:
- Structured data fields for consistency
- Quality check checklists
- Source traceability requirements
- Validation criteria
- Review and approval sections

## Template Customization

Templates can be customized based on:
- Specific audit file characteristics
- Project-specific requirements
- Team preferences and workflows
- Quality assurance needs

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Consistency**: Use templates consistently across all files and assessments
2. **Completeness**: Fill out all relevant sections for comprehensive analysis
3. **Traceability**: Maintain clear references to source audit files
4. **Quality**: Use built-in quality checks and validation criteria
5. **Documentation**: Record assessment rationale and decision-making process
