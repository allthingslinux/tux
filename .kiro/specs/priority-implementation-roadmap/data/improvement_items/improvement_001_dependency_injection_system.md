## Title: Implement Comprehensive Dependency Injection System

## Description: 
Implement a comprehensive dependency injection container to eliminate the repeated instantiation of DatabaseController and other services across 35-40+ cog files. This addresses the core architectural issue where every cog directly instantiates services, creating tight coupling, testing difficulties, resource waste, and systematic DRY violations.

## Category: 
Architecture

## Source Files:
- 01_codebase_audit_report.md - Core finding: "Every cog follows identical initialization"
- 02_initialization_patterns_analysis.md - Pattern analysis: "Direct instantiation found in 35+ occurrences"
- 03_database_access_patterns_analysis.md - Architecture analysis: "Pattern 1: Direct Instantiation (35+ cogs)"
- 04_tight_coupling_analysis.md - Coupling analysis: "Every cog directly instantiates DatabaseController()"
- 09_code_duplication_analysis.md - Duplication analysis: "Identical initialization pattern across all cogs"

## Affected Components:
- All 35-40+ cog files across entire codebase
- DatabaseController and all sub-controllers
- Bot initialization and service management
- Base classes (ModerationCogBase, SnippetsBaseCog)
- Testing infrastructure and mocking systems

## Problem Statement:
Every cog in the system follows the identical pattern of `self.db = DatabaseController()` and `self.bot = bot`, creating multiple instances of the same services, tight coupling between cogs and implementations, and making unit testing extremely difficult as it requires full bot and database setup for every test.

## Proposed Solution:
Create a service container that manages service lifecycles and provides clean dependency injection:

1. **Service Container Implementation**:
   - Central registry for all services (database, bot interface, configuration)
   - Lifecycle management (singleton, transient, scoped)
   - Automatic dependency resolution and injection

2. **Service Interface Definitions**:
   - Abstract interfaces for all major services
   - Protocol-based definitions for testing compatibility
   - Clear separation between interface and implementation

3. **Cog Integration**:
   - Modify cog initialization to receive injected dependencies
   - Update base classes to use dependency injection
   - Provide migration path for existing cogs

4. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Mock service implementations for unit testing
   - Test-specific service configurations
   - Isolated testing without full system setup

## Success Metrics:
- Elimination of 35+ direct DatabaseController() instantiations
- 100% of cogs using dependency injection for service access
- Unit tests executable without full bot/database setup
- 60% reduction in cog initialization boilerplate code
- Zero direct service instantiation in cog constructors

## Dependencies:
- None (foundational improvement)

## Risk Factors:
- **High Complexity**: Requires changes to all cog files and base classes
- **Migration Risk**: Potential breaking changes during transition
- **Testing Overhead**: Extensive testing required to ensure no regressions
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand dependency injection patterns

## Implementation Notes:
- **Estimated Effort**: 3-4 person-weeks for core implementation + 2-3 weeks for migration
- **Required Skills**: Advanced Python patterns, architectural design, testing frameworks
- **Testing Requirements**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests for all affected cogs
- **Documentation Updates**: New developer onboarding materials, architectural documentation

## Validation Criteria:
- **Code Review**: All cog files reviewed for proper dependency injection usage
- **Testing Validation**: All existing functionality works with new architecture
- **Performance Testing**: No performance degradation from service container overhead
- **Documentation Review**: Complete documentation of new patterns and migration guide
