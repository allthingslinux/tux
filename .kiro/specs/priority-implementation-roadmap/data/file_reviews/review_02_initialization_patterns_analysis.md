## File Type: Analysis

## Key Insights:
- **Standard Initialization Pattern**: Basic pattern found in 25+ cogs with `self.bot = bot` and `self.db = DatabaseController()`
- **Extended Pattern with Usage Generation**: Found in 15+ cogs with additional manual usage generation for each command
- **Base Class Pattern**: Found in 8+ cogs using ModerationCogBase or SnippetsBaseCog for shared functionality
- **Service Pattern with Configuration**: Found in 3+ cogs with extensive configuration loading (8+ config assignments)
- **Database Controller Instantiation**: 35+ direct instantiations, 8+ through base class, 5+ specialized controller access
- **Usage Generation Pattern**: 100+ manual occurrences across all cogs with varying patterns by cog type
- **Anti-Patterns Identified**: Repeated database controller instantiation, manual usage generation, inconsistent base class usage

## Recommendations:
- **High Priority - Dependency Injection Container**: Centralize instance management to eliminate repeated instantiation (Impact: High, Effort: Medium)
- **High Priority - Automatic Usage Generation**: Use decorators or metaclasses to eliminate manual boilerplate (Impact: High, Effort: Medium)
- **Medium Priority - Consistent Base Classes**: Extend base class pattern to all cogs for standardization (Impact: Medium, Effort: Medium)
- **Medium Priority - Configuration Injection**: Make configuration injectable rather than scattered access (Impact: Medium, Effort: Low)
- **Low Priority - Service Locator Pattern**: Centralize service access for better organization (Impact: Low, Effort: Medium)

## Quantitative Data:
- **Basic Pattern Occurrences**: 25+ cogs
- **Extended Pattern Occurrences**: 15+ cogs  
- **Base Class Pattern Occurrences**: 8+ cogs
- **Service Pattern Occurrences**: 3+ cogs
- **Direct Database Instantiations**: 35+ occurrences
- **Base Class Database Access**: 8+ occurrences
- **Specialized Controller Access**: 5+ occurrences
- **Manual Usage Generations**: 100+ occurrences
- **Admin Cog Usage Generations**: 5-10 per cog
- **Moderation Cog Usage Generations**: 1-2 per cog
- **Utility Cog Usage Generations**: 1-3 per cog
- **Service Cog Usage Generations**: 0-1 per cog

## Implementation Details:
- **ModerationCogBase**: Provides database controller, moderation utilities, error handling, user action locking, embed helpers
- **SnippetsBaseCog**: Provides database controller, snippet utilities, permission checking, embed creation, error handling
- **Configuration Loading**: Simple (most cogs) vs Complex (service cogs with 8+ config assignments)
- **Dependency Relationships**: Direct (bot instance, database controller), Indirect (EmbedCreator, generate_usage), External (Discord.py, Prisma, Sentry)
- **Specialized Examples**: tux/cogs/services/levels.py with extensive config loading, tux/cogs/guild/config.py with specialized controller access
