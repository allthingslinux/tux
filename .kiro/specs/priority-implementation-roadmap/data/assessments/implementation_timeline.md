2. **002 - Base Classes** (Month 3): Enables optimal integration of 003, 004
3. **005 - Bot Interface** (Month 4): Enables comprehensive testing

### Parallel Opportunities
- **003 - Embed Factory**: Can run parallel with DI implementation
- **004 - Error Handling**: Can run parallel with base class implementation
- **006 - Validation**: Can run independently in final phase

### Risk Mitigation in Timeline
- **Buffer Time**: 15-20% buffer built into each phase
- **Pilot Batches**: DI migration done in batches to reduce risk
- **Rollback Points**: Clear rollback points at end of each month
- **Continuous Testing**: QA involvement throughout, not just at end
