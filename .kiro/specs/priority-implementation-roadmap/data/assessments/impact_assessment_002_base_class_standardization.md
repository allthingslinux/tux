## Overall Impact Score: 7.25
**Calculation**: (4 + 9 + 7 + 9) / 4 = 7.25

## Impact Summary
This improvement delivers **exceptional developer productivity gains** while significantly reducing technical debt. The standardization of patterns across 40+ cog files creates a consistent, maintainable architecture that will benefit all future development.

## Business Value Justification
- **Developer Efficiency**: 9/10 productivity improvement accelerates all cog development
- **Code Quality**: Consistent patterns reduce bugs and improve maintainability
- **Onboarding Speed**: New developers learn one pattern applicable everywhere
- **Maintenance Reduction**: Base class changes improve all cogs simultaneously
- **Future Development**: Establishes foundation for consistent feature development

## Implementation Priority
**Critical Priority** - Should be implemented immediately after dependency injection as it builds upon DI and provides the foundation for consistent development patterns across the entire codebase.
