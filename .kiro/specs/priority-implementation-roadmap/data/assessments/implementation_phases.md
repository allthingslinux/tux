# Implementation Phases

## Overview
This document groups improvements into logical implementation phases based on technical dependencies, priority scores, thematic coherence, and resource optimization.

## Phase Design Principles

### Grouping Criteria
1. **Technical Dependencies**: Prerequisite relationships must be respected
2. **Thematic Coherence**: Related improvements grouped for synergy
3. **Resource Balance**: Distribute effort evenly across phases
4. **Risk Management**: Balance high-risk and low-risk items
5. **Value Delivery**: Ensure each phase delivers meaningful value

### Phase Characteristics
- **Clear Themes**: Each phase has a focused objective
- **Balanced Effort**: Similar resource requirements across phases
- **Incremental Value**: Each phase builds on previous achievements
- **Manageable Scope**: Phases are sized for effective management

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation and Quick Wins (Months 1-2)
**Theme**: Establish architectural foundation while delivering immediate user value

#### Items Included
- **001 - Dependency Injection System** (Priority: 1.03, Effort: 7.25)

#### Implementation Strategy
- **Weeks 1-2**: 002 (Base Classes) foundation

**Phase 1**: 003 (1.73), 004 (1.68) - Highest priority items
**Phase 2**: 006 (1.33), 002 (1.26) - Medium-high priority
**Phase 3**: 005 (1.04), 001 (1.03) - Lower priority but foundational

**Rejected Because**: Violates technical dependencies (002 needs 001, 004 benefits from 002)

### Alternative 2: Effort-Balanced Grouping
**Phase 1**: 001 (7.25), 003 (3.75) - 11 weeks

### Alternative 3: Theme-Pure Grouping
**Phase 1**: 001, 002, 005 - Pure architecture
**Phase 2**: 003, 004 - Pure user experience
**Phase 3**: 006 - Pure security

**Rejected Because**: Creates unbalanced effort distribution and delays quick wins
