#### 5. Bot Interface Abstraction (Priority Score: 1.04)
**Classification**: MEDIUM PRIORITY
- **Impact Score**: 6.75/10 (High developer productivity, low user impact)
- **Effort Score**: 6.5/10 (High effort due to complexity)
- **Priority Calculation**: 6.75 ÷ 6.5 = 1.04

**Priority Justification**:
- **Architectural Value**: Exceptional developer productivity (9/10) and debt reduction (9/10)
- **Testing Foundation**: Enables comprehensive testing across entire codebase
- **High Complexity**: Complex interface design and 100+ access points to abstract
- **Internal Focus**: Primarily benefits developers rather than end users

**Implementation Recommendation**: Important for architecture but high implementation cost

---

#### 6. Dependency Injection System (Priority Score: 1.03)
**Classification**: MEDIUM PRIORITY (Strategic Override: CRITICAL)
- **Impact Score**: 7.5/10 (High technical debt reduction, foundational)
- **Effort Score**: 7.25/10 (Very high effort due to architectural complexity)
- **Priority Calculation**: 7.5 ÷ 7.25 = 1.03

**Priority Justification**:
- **Foundational**: Required by other improvements, enables modern architecture
- **Maximum Debt Reduction**: Highest technical debt reduction score (10/10)
- **Very High Effort**: Highest implementation effort due to system-wide impact
- **Strategic Importance**: Essential foundation despite balanced priority score

**Implementation Recommendation**: Must be implemented first despite balanced priority score due to foundational nature
