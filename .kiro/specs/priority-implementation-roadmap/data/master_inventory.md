## Review Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: High-priority Analysis and Strategy files (core insights)
2. **Phase 2**: High-priority Architecture and Implementation files (technical details)
3. **Phase 3**: Medium-priority files (supporting information)
4. **Phase 4**: Low-priority Configuration and Template files (process documentation)

## Notes
- High priority files contain core architectural insights and strategic decisions
- Architecture Decision Records provide formal decision documentation
- Core implementation files contain actual code examples and patterns
- Templates provide structured approaches for implementation
- Review should prioritize Analysis → Strategy → Architecture → Implementation order
