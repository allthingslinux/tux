# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Tux Discord bot project has grown organically, resulting in a project structure within the `tux/` directory that lacks clear separation of concerns and optimal organization. This architectural refactor aims to improve maintainability, readability, scalability, and developer experience by implementing a more intentional project structure. The refactor will reorganize existing code into a cleaner architecture while maintaining all current functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to Tux, I want a clear and intuitive project structure so that I can quickly locate and understand different components of the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer explores the project structure THEN they SHALL be able to identify the purpose of each directory within 30 seconds
2. WHEN looking for Discord-related functionality THEN it SHALL be clearly separated from backend services and utilities
3. WHEN examining the structure THEN related components SHALL be co-located rather than spread across multiple directories
4. WHEN navigating the codebase THEN the separation between core logic, user-facing features, and utilities SHALL be immediately apparent

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a maintainer of Tux, I want improved code organization so that maintenance tasks and feature development become more efficient and less error-prone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing a new feature THEN developers SHALL have a clear location to place related code components
2. WHEN modifying existing functionality THEN all related code SHALL be discoverable within the same logical grouping
3. WHEN reviewing code changes THEN the impact scope SHALL be easily identifiable based on the directory structure
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN the separation of concerns SHALL make it easier to isolate problems to specific layers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project architect, I want a scalable structure so that the project can accommodate future growth including potential web dashboard, API, or other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning future applications THEN the current structure SHALL support adding new applications without major restructuring
2. WHEN shared code is needed across multiple applications THEN it SHALL be clearly identified and accessible
3. WHEN external services or APIs are integrated THEN they SHALL have a designated place in the architecture
4. WHEN the project grows in complexity THEN the structure SHALL continue to provide clear boundaries and organization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a new contributor to Tux, I want an intuitive project layout so that I can quickly understand the codebase and start contributing effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new developer joins the project THEN they SHALL be able to understand the high-level architecture within their first hour
2. WHEN looking for examples of similar functionality THEN they SHALL be able to find them in predictable locations
3. WHEN following common Discord bot development patterns THEN the structure SHALL align with community standards and expectations
4. WHEN reading documentation or tutorials THEN the project structure SHALL support and enhance the learning experience

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working on specific features, I want related code components grouped together so that I can work efficiently without constantly switching between distant directories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working on a Discord command THEN related UI components, business logic, and utilities SHALL be easily accessible
2. WHEN implementing a feature THEN all necessary components SHALL be co-located or have clear, short import paths
3. WHEN testing functionality THEN test files SHALL be organized to mirror the main code structure
4. WHEN refactoring code THEN the impact on other components SHALL be minimized through proper separation of concerns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator deploying Tux, I want a clear separation between application code and configuration so that deployment and environment management are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the entry points SHALL be clearly identified and documented
2. WHEN configuring different environments THEN application code SHALL be separate from configuration and environment-specific files
3. WHEN troubleshooting deployment issues THEN the application structure SHALL support easy identification of dependencies and components
4. WHEN scaling the application THEN the modular structure SHALL support selective deployment of components if needed

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining backward compatibility, I want the refactor to preserve all existing functionality so that no features are lost or broken during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN all existing Discord commands SHALL continue to function identically
2. WHEN the refactor is applied THEN all database operations SHALL work without modification
3. WHEN testing the refactored code THEN all existing tests SHALL pass without functional changes
4. WHEN users interact with the bot THEN they SHALL experience no difference in functionality or behavior
5. WHEN external integrations are used THEN they SHALL continue to work without requiring updates

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer working with the codebase, I want clear import paths and dependency relationships so that I can understand and modify code without introducing circular dependencies or architectural violations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing modules THEN the import paths SHALL clearly indicate the architectural layer and purpose
2. WHEN adding new dependencies THEN the structure SHALL prevent circular imports through clear hierarchical organization
3. WHEN examining code THEN the dependency flow SHALL follow a consistent pattern from high-level to low-level components
4. WHEN refactoring imports THEN the new structure SHALL support automated tools for import organization and validation
