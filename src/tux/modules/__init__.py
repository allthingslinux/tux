"""Tux bot modules package.

This package contains all the feature modules for the Tux Discord bot.
Each module is a self-contained package that provides specific functionality.

This is a namespace package - individual modules are imported directly
(e.g., from tux.modules.moderation import cases) rather than through this package.
